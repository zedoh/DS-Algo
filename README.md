### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description
- This repo is my studying log and practicing in Data Structures and Algorithms course, You may find mistakes in the implementation or The problems solutions, as this is my own practicing on these topics and this repo shouldn't be taken as a reference for learning these topics.
- **Feel free to provide suggestions or improvements to the code. Your feedback is appreciated!**

### Data Structures
- For each data structure, there is an implementation and challenges solution. Challenges solutions may be in the exact implementation file or separate files as I sometimes use the built-in STL containers.

1. Vectors **TODO**
2. [Linked List](/DS/Single%20Linked%20List/)
3. [Double Linked List](/DS/Double%20Linked%20List/)
4. [Stack](/DS/Stack/)
5. [Queue](/DS/Queue/)
6. [Binary Tree](/DS/Binary%20Tree/)
7. [Binary Search Tree](/DS/Binary%20Search%20Tree/)
8. [Trie](/DS/Trie/) 
9. AVL Tree **TODO**
10. Hash Table **TODO**
