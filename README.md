### Description
This repo is my studying log and practicing on Data structures and Algorithms course , You may find mistakes in the implementation or The problems solutions , as this is my own practicing on these topics and this repo shouldn't be taken as a reference for learning these topics.

### Data Structures
For each data structure, there is an implementation and challenges solution. Challenges solutions may be in the same implementation file or in a separate file as I sometimes use the built-in STL containers.
