# Easy Challanges
  - [Tree Max](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L33-L44)
 -  [Max Depth](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L47-L52)
  - [Path Sum](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L66-L69)
  - [is perfect](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L143-L145)
    - In this problem I used 2 Utility functions:
    -  [`nodes`](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L46-49) , This function is to return the number of nodes in a binary tree($1-based$).
     - [`levels`](/DS/Binary%20Tree/BinaryTree.hpp#L51-L57), return the number of levels in a binary tree ($Zero-based$).
